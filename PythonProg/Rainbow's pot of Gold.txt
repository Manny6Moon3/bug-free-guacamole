'Open Sesame?' Is that the cantrip which is supposed to have been used by that crazy Fay to get this damned
dynamic duo to fly blind through the silver lining of hankering into the nether-verse over Neuschwabenland.
Where the crystalline echoes of a Golden Eagle shrieking through the dusk find the rerefractions in stellar
tones all too ambient? The disturbing thing about wanting to elaborate on the skywards dynamics of such like
evident 'battles of the gods' ruminations out of sections of the Ramayana - is that the ancestral lands of
the Indo-Europeans had 1. Acoustic Rock (Tuning-Fork-Stone) Temples where it seems as if a functional aspect
of these - was that the psionic faculties of (the more refined) ancestors of those Fakirs and Psyched-up 
Swami's who had a Phoenician Societal Caste stratification within their entire cultural system; possessed
from these sacred utilities---almost an inadvertent way of amplifying that manner of PRAYERS which are sung.
More than said. A seminary of the miraculous, one may say. Alright, not disturbing, but disconcerting to 
realize that Cyclopean building techniques may have used choirs of 'special' Priest-Mage Musicians whose 
main forte was to defy gravity by virtue of these strange states of mind which they accessed, on a par with
the semantic sigaldry and magnetized waterworks in such places of 'worship'. The Vailixi and the Vimanas
designed on parchments - found in the Himalayan and Nepalese mountains, have doubtless scored their Ultima
Thule signification into the space programmes of certain Asian countries, much as the 'Land of the Wise
Serpents' would like to enact certain stages of blank incredulity to sweep that fact under the rug. Where
the Yanks went to be protectorates after the League of Nations are probably not even exceptions to the rule
anymore. The Majestic 12 can't be the be-all and end-all in this, can they? Cock 'n Bull rub of Alladin's lamp.
